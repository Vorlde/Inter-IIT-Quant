# Inter IIT Quant 11.0

I'm pleased to announce that our team, #B76, earned a silver medal at the Inter IIT Tech Meet 11.0. My colleague Rohit and I led the team to tackle QuantInsti's problem statement on the effectiveness of price action trading strategies in the Indian equities market. Our team developed advanced tools and methods to detect price action signals automatically. We formulated a hypothesis that explored the tendency of the market to retrace and fill inefficiencies, which could create potential opportunities for profitable trades in liquid stocks. Our team identified inefficient candles from the OHLC chart and tested this hypothesis on over 60+ stocks. We selected the stocks based on a filter for liquid, moderately volatile, and non-penny stocks from all the listed stocks available in Blueshift.

Our results showed that the market retraced back to the inefficient zone 99.8% of the time. We also tested the profitability of this hypothesis in low frequency and generated consistent profits from the market. To decrease false signals and fix the noise, we converted the 1-minute price-time data to price-volume with dynamic volume bins. We took entry next to the verified candle and squared off when the high of the market reached the upper zone. We confirmed our consistent profits through backtesting over multiple stocks.

This event helped me grow as a team leader and taught me many valuable lessons. I am grateful to my hardworking and dedicated teammates, including Himanshu Kumar, Samarth Pusalkar, Shaunak Natarajan, Amlan Biswas, Kartik, Piyush Banka, and Prajyot, who played an instrumental role in achieving our impressive results.
